   ```
   - just one project
      $ git submodule init directory_name
      
   - all
      $ git submodule init
      
   $ git submodule update
      
   ```

**to do list:**  
   - **libft**:
   ```
     - dont change anymore, just use ft_printf's libft.a for future projects
     - let it be memory of how lost you once were
   ```
   - **ft_printf**
   ```
     - really should do this again from start with higher speed and little better structs and less if statements
       - probably just make light ft_printf with less functions and without so many flags
   ```
   - **push_swap**:
   ```
     - add in readme the idea of how it is doing the sorting
     - make external visualizer so you dont have to have minilibx and take mlx out of core project
   ```
   - **lem-in**:
   ```
     - add flags
       - ~~leaks~~
       - ~~show what ended the reading~~
       - ~~time~~
       - ~~how many turns it took~~
       - ~~show routes~~
       - show all possible  routes? (maybe for smaller maps or max routes arount 100?)
       - ~~change/overwrite number of ants~~
     - ~~external visualizer~~ no
   ```
   - **corewar**:
   ```
     - final project in algorithmic branch (original https://github.com/jussihyva/corewar)
     - with:
       - shilena91
       - jussihyva
   ```
