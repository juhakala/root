place to store projects done in school

   ```
   - just one project
      $ git submodule init directory_name
      
   - all
      $ git submodule init
      
   $ git submodule update
      
   ```

**to do list:**  
   - **libft**:
   ```
     - dont change anymore, just use ft_printf's libft.a for future projects
     - let it be memory of how lost you once were
   ```
   - **ft_printf**
   ```
     - really should do this again from start with higher speed and little better structs and less if statements
       - probably just make light ft_printf with less functions and without so many flags
   ```
   - **push_swap**:
   ```
     - [ ] add in readme the idea of how it is doing the sorting
     - [x] minilibx visualizer
     - [ ] external visualizer so you dont have to have minilibx and take mlx out of core project
   ```
   - **lem-in**:
   ```
     - add flags
       - [x] leaks
       - [x] show what ended the reading
       - [x] time
       - [x] how many turns it took
       - [x] show routes
       - [ ] show all possible  routes? (maybe for smaller maps or max routes arount 100?)
       - [x] change/overwrite number of ants
     - [ ] external visualizer
   ```
   - **corewar**:
   ```
