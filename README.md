**to do list:**  
   - **libft**:
   ```
     - dont change anymore, just use ft_printf's libft.a for future projects
     - let it be memory of how lost you once were
   ```
   - **ft_printf**
   ```
     - really should do this again from start with higher speed and little better structs and less if statements
       - probably just make light ft_printf with less functions and without so many flags
   ```
   - **push_swap**:
   ```
     - add in readme the idea of how it is doing the sorting
     - make external visualizer so you dont have to have minilibx and take mlx out of core project
   ```
   - **lem-in**:(check working repository, this is just some core things, not working things in here)
   ```
     - add flags
       - leaks
       - show what ended the reading
       - time
       - how many turns it took
       - show routes
       - show all possible  routes? (maybe for smaller maps or max routes arount 100?)
       - change/overwrite number of ants
     - just move ants now and make it pretty
     - external visualizer maybe?
   ```
