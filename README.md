   - ft_printf:
     - really should do this again from start with higher speed and litle better structs and less if statements
   - push_swap:
     - add in readme the idea of how it is doing the sorting
     - make external visualizer so you dont have to have minilibx and take mlx out of core project
   - lem-in:
